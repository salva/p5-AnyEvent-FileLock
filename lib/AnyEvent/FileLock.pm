=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::FileLock - Lock files asynchronously

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AnyEvent::FileLock;

  my $w = AnyEvent::FileLock->flock(file => $fn,
                                    cb => sub { ... },
                                    mode => '<',
                                    delay => $seconds,
                                    timeout => $timeout);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module tries to lock some file repeatedly until it success or a
timeout happens.

=head2 API

The function provides a unique method C<flock> accepting the following
arguments:

=over 4

=item fh => $file_handle

When this argument is given the passed file handle is used as the file
locking target.

=item file => $file_name

When this argument is given a file with the given name will be opened
or created and then the module will try to lock it.

=item type => $lock_type

C<$lock_type> may be C<fcntl> or C<flock> and determines the way used
to obtain the lock under the hood.

The default is C<flock>.

In order to use locks of type C<fcntl>, the module L<Fctnl::Packer>
has to be also installed.

=item cb => $sub_ref

The given function is called once the lock is acquired on the
file with the file handle passed as an argument.

In case of error (i.e. timeout) C<undef> will be passed instead of the
file handle. The error can be retrieved from C<$!>.

The user is responsible for closing the file handle or calling
C<flock($fh, LOCK_UN)> (or the corresponding L<fcntl(2)> F<F_UNLCK>)
on it when required.

=item open_mode => $mode

The mode used to open the file when the argument C<file> is
passed. Accepted values are C<< < >>, C<< > >>, C<<< >> >>>, C<< +< >>
and C<< +> >>.

=item lock_mode => $mode

The mode used when locking the file, it accepts the same set of values
as C<open_mode>. C<< < >> means shared access and everything else
exclusive access.

=item mode => $mode

Configures both C<open_mode> and C<lock_mode>.

=item timeout => $seconds

The operation is aborted if the lock operation can not be completed
for the given lapse.

Note that this timeout is approximate, it is checked just after every
failed locking attempt.

=item delay => $seconds

Time to be delayed between consecutive locking attempts. Defaults to 1
second.

Some randomness will be added to the delay to avoid the degenerate
case where all the contenders look for the lock at the same time
every time.

=item whence => $whence

=item start => $start

=item len => $len

When C<fcntl> is selected as the lock type, this three additional
arguments can be used to define the section of the file that has to be
locked. See L<fcntl(2)> for the details.
